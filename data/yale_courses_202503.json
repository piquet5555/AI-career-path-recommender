We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness.&#160;Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.<\/p>",

Rather than interpret black feminist theory as a critical formation that simply puts race, gender, sexuality, and class into conversation with one another, the course apprehends that formation as one that produced epistemic shifts in how we understand politics, empire, history, the law, and literature. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the areas into which black feminism intervened. It is merely a sample of some of the most vibrant ideological and discursive contexts in which black feminism caused certain epistemic transformations. &#160;<\/p>",

But, we also look closely at the richness of love and intimacy, the radical roots of self-fashioning, and the insurgent potentiality of mobility and aesthetic creativity coursing through the lives of her protagonists who cut a fugitive path out of slavery, ride the waves of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, Civil Rights era hope and organizing, and post-Soul searching. We read key scholarship in direct conversation with Morrison\u2019s oeuvre, and we examine her robust and demanding critical essays on American literature, on contemporary events, and on the topic of writing.<\/p>",

However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual\/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \u201ctropics\u201d has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique\u2019s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.&#160;&#160;<\/p>",

Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences. Considering an expansive array of poets, playwrights, and novelists - such as Baron de Vastey, Juste Chanlatte, Demesvar Delorme, Edwidge Danticat, Ren\u00e9 Depestre, Kettly Mars, Dany Laferri\u00e8re, and \u00c9velyne Trouillot \u2013 this course engages students in a fresh examination of Haiti\u2019s richly polyglot and transnational literary tradition that spans more than two centuries.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>This course explores the practice of enslavement in the Americas from the beginnings of colonization through the nineteenth century. The racialized slavery that emerged in the Americas was new to World History, developed by European colonists to exploit the natural resources of the Americas. Initially, European colonists enslaved indigenous peoples wherever possible, yet by the late sixteenth century the enslavement of Africans had become far more common. We focus upon North American and the Caribbean, where European colonists developed sophisticated agricultural enterprises that produced for export to the European market and were completely dependent upon the enslaved labor of Africans. An enormous ocean commerce trafficked almost twelve million enslaved captives from the Atlantic coasts of Africa to work on the plantations of the Americas. The commerce in tobacco, sugar, rum, and cotton enabled these colonies to develop. Black people resisted enslavement at multiple levels, and throughout the Americas there emerged the Black cultures, languages, musics, struggles, and histories that we know and love today.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Mass incarceration and police violence are pressing human rights issues in the contemporary Americas. The US carceral state is sweeping, with nearly 2 million people currently incarcerated on any given day and a targeted policing apparatus that brings people under the penal net. At the same time, countries in Latin America have high rates of incarceration and often even higher rates of police violence than the US. These dynamics are deeply racialized and shape individuals, families, and communities. But that is not the full story. Liberatory movements have resisted and surged against this subjugation for decades. In this course, students will comparatively study the development of the contemporary carceral state and the political struggles waged against it. Students will read across the social sciences, Black studies, history, and law, as well as performance, memoir, and testimony. By examining the carceral state in this way, students will gain a critical lens on longstanding debates related to race and racism, justice and injustice, and reparation and abolition, in both the US and Latin America. While the course is not exhaustive, it is meant to equip students with a working framework on the critical debates in the field.<\/p>",

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love.&#160;In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other?&#160;In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States. In this section, we explore reining assumptions between romantic love and: marriage; monogamy; dating; the digital environment; queerness; age; and transnationalism.<\/p>",

Griffin, Joan Morgan, Danyel Smith, Wesley Morris, Hanif Abdurraqib, and others. Emphasis will be placed on music, literary, film, and theater\/performance arts writing.<\/p>",

But, we also look closely at the richness of love and intimacy, the radical roots of self-fashioning, and the insurgent potentiality of mobility and aesthetic creativity coursing through the lives of her protagonists who cut a fugitive path out of slavery, ride the waves of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, Civil Rights era hope and organizing, and post-Soul searching. We read key scholarship in direct conversation with Morrison\u2019s oeuvre, and we examine her robust and demanding critical essays on American literature, on contemporary events, and on the topic of writing.<\/p>",

This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war\u2014also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war\u2014has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Uwe Johnson's <em>Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl<\/em> remains a monument of postwar German literature \u2013 and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>",

From Hannah Nikole Jones\u2019 1619 Project to the first Trump administration\u2019s 1776 Commission, from the \u201coriginalism\u201d or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called \u201cdark enlightenment\u201d thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies\u2014an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields\u2014 the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and\/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what \u201cAmericanness\u201d meant, looked like, or represented.&#160;<\/p>",

For whether we have in mind a velvet armchair, a pair of distressed jeans, a handbound book, or a tablet computer, texture performs a dramatic revelation to the extent that it is also shadowed by deception and ambivalence.&#160;These paradoxes and cruxes inspire a range of inquiries for our class: What can the perception and creation of texture teach us about the sensorial and material politics of race, gender, empire, capitalism, and art? How might texture help us study the relation between desire and violence, especially at the interface of touch? What things, beings, events, places, emotions, and ideas appear to have a texture? What is texture\u2019s route to intelligibility, and is there a scale or unit at which texture vanishes?<\/p>",

The many topics encountered along the way include the public and private investment in the built environment; history of housing in America; transportation and infrastructure; architectural practice; and the social and political nature of city building and urban change. Attention also paid to the transnational nature of American architecture\u2014the role of colonialism, the global exchange of architectural ideas, and the international careers of some architects. We will take advantage of our local setting, New Haven, as a cross-section of American architectural and urban history and a storehouse of key examples of building types, urban landscapes, and architectural styles. Upon completion, students should be expected to grasp the basic periods, trends, and processes in American architectural history and their connection to urban patterns. This course aims to give students the tools to appreciate and interpret the built environments that surround them, from impressive monuments to ordinary structures<\/p>",

Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences. Considering an expansive array of poets, playwrights, and novelists - such as Baron de Vastey, Juste Chanlatte, Demesvar Delorme, Edwidge Danticat, Ren\u00e9 Depestre, Kettly Mars, Dany Laferri\u00e8re, and \u00c9velyne Trouillot \u2013 this course engages students in a fresh examination of Haiti\u2019s richly polyglot and transnational literary tradition that spans more than two centuries.<\/p>",

Students will examine how theories of performativity have expanded our understanding of dramatic structure beyond traditional theatrical contexts. The course investigates how social movements, cultural rituals, and everyday interactions can be analyzed through dramaturgical frameworks, while broadening the definition of \"texts\" that can be adapted for performance. Through both theoretical study and practical application, students will develop core dramaturgical skills by analyzing diverse performance texts for structure, meaning, and cultural context. Course projects include collaborating on a literary adaptation with a director and participating in a devised work with a contemporary artist, emphasizing the dramaturg's role as a cultural interpreter, creative collaborator, and social critic in today's performance landscape.

It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Although we spend approximately one third of our lives asleep, since the industrial revolution and the emergence of uninterrupted city lighting, industrialized societies seem to have developed an ambivalent relation to sleep: both protected and devalued for the sake of higher standards of productive work. The devaluation of sleep, in particular, has produced, during the twentieth and the first two decades of the twenty-first centuries, an array of social, political, and medical discourses to study the impact of changing patterns of sleep and sleeplessness at the global level. This seminar studies topics in the politics and cultures of sleep and sleeplessness, which posit sleep as a human practice. As any human practice, it is framed by cultural and political settings, so that how, when, why, where, and who sleeps vary across sectors of society, across past and present and across world cultures. We study historical, literary, philosophical, sociological, political, and filmic texts. A cultural, social, and political understanding of sleep and sleeplessness can reveal how sleep has been transformed into a bodily site upon which social values are imposed, social surveillance is enacted, ideas about \u201cnormality\u201d are instrumentalized, resulting in a demand that humans adapt to human-made changing conditions of production, rather than universally unchanging health needs.<\/p>",

The phrase \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d suggests that the act of eating is one of entrenchment: food choices represent and intensify one\u2019s own cultural and personal identity. But considering that issues of food access, public health, and unfair or illegal food labor practices within the food system cut across race and class boundaries, this may now be an inaccurate\u2013or at the very least\u2013uncomfortable maxim. This course interrogates themes of identity, ethnicity, race, land, and power to better understand the complexity of human relationships with food. We focus on how individual and group identity is constructed, affirmed, or refused through food choices by surveying foundational works within the field of food studies and connecting them to the pressing social issues of today, particularly as they manifest in the everyday act of eating.<\/p>",

In addition, the General Theory of Relativity opened up for the first time a quantitative study of cosmology, of the history of the universe as a whole. Albert Einstein was at the center of these breakthroughs, and also became an iconic figure beyond physics, representing scientist genius engaged in pure research into the fundamental laws of nature. This course addresses the nature of the transition to modern physics, underpinned by quantum and relativity theory, through study of Einstein\u2019s science, biography, and historical context. It also presents the basic concepts in electromagnetic theory, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, special theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics which were central to this revolutionary epoch in science.<\/p>",

What were the roots and social processes that gave rise to such systems? In this seminar, we explore archaeological evidence for the development of social and political organization and religious practices, using selected examples from East and Southeast Asia spanning approximately 5000 BCE to 1500 CE. We examine four key themes: (1) the origins and timing of plant and animal domestication, (2) the emergence and impact of early metallurgy, (3) patterns of interregional interaction, and (4) the rise of sociopolitical complexity. Using a comparative archaeological perspective\u2014focusing on settlement patterns, urbanism, craft production, monumentality, and diverse material culture\u2014we examine how both local factors and long-distance connections shaped these trajectories. We conclude the course with a reflection on the role of archaeology in contemporary society, particularly in countries where the past is actively curated, celebrated, and contested.<\/p>",

For decades Neanderthals were portrayed as nasty, brutish, and passively lacking the talent and innovation that allowed humans to survive and thrive. Recently, they have become celebrated as our close cousins or even just another group of ancient humans. But what does modern science say about Neanderthal life and extinction, and what do Neanderthals tell us about ourselves? By asking the question \u201cwere Neanderthals human,\u201d this course examines what it actually means to <em>be <\/em>human. Students learn the archaeological, fossil, and biomolecular records of Neanderthals, early modern humans, and other contemporaneous human relatives.&#160; They also learn the foundations of human evolutionary science, with a focus on the Middle and Late Pleistocene (770,000 to 11,500 years ago), when the genus <em>Homo<\/em> diversified into as many as seven species\u2013including our own.&#160;<\/p>",

Participants in the course work with real, cutting-edge data collected here at Yale. They become familiar with an array of current software tools, denoising and processing techniques, and quantitative analysis methods that are used in the pursuit of extracting meaningful information from imaging data.&#160;The subject matter of this course ranges from bioenergetics, metabolic pathways, molecular processes, brain receptor kinetics, protein expression and interactions to wide spread functional networks, long-range connectivity, and organ-level brain organization. The course provides a unique hands-on experience with processing and analyzing <em>in vitro<\/em> and <em>in vivo<\/em> bioimaging and biosensing data that is relevant to current research topics. The specific imaging modes which are covered include&#160;<em>in vivo<\/em>&#160;magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), functional, structural, and molecular imaging (MRI), wide-field fluorescent optical imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET). The course provides the necessary background in biochemistry, bioenergetics, and biophysics for students to motivate the image manipulations which they learn to perform.<\/p>",

This course explores the molecular and computational underpinnings of how these decisions are made, with a focus on modeling static and dynamic processes in example biological systems. This course is aimed at biology students and teaches the analytic and computational methods needed to model genetic networks and protein signaling pathways. Students present and discuss original papers in class. They learn to model using MatLab in a series of in-class hackathons that illustrate the biological examples discussed in the lectures. Biological systems and processes that are modeled include: (i) gene expression, including the kinetics of RNA and protein synthesis and degradation; (ii) activators and repressors; (iii) the lysogeny\/lysis switch of lambda phage; (iv) network motifs and how they shape response dynamics; (v) cell signaling, MAP kinase networks and cell fate decisions; and (vi) noise in gene expression.<\/p>",

There is also considerable hype surrounding AI and many concerns (some justified, some not) regarding the use of this type of technology. This discussion-based seminar will 1) provide undergraduate students across disciplines with a broad overview of issues related to AI in medicine at a non-technical level, drawing on perspectives from the interpretive\/humanistic social sciences, computing, engineering, and healthcare and 2) model interdisciplinary communication and build a robust framework for collaboration. Overarching topics, grounded in medical case studies, include what it means for computers to \u201cthink\u201d and how we understand what they are thinking about; the use and limits of scientific knowledge in making policy decisions; bias, fairness, equity, equality; the challenges of implementation of AI systems; safety and risk; and the human\/computer interface. The course also provides a high level overview of machine learning, discussing opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs. Ultimately, the course offers a grounded look at how AI is being discussed and deployed on the ground in medicine, equipping students with a critical lens for thinking about responsible and practical implementation and innovation when it comes to AI.<\/p>",

This means considering not only traditional masculine and military conceptions of rule but also the leadership roles and styles of women, slaves, and rebels. We hope to bring into view, in other words, the intersectional challenges to power faced by non-traditional leaders in a world dominated by gender, class, and cultural prejudices, and to show how non-traditional leaders confronted and overcame these. Students draw upon this experience to access the premodern world as an alternative but related historical reality which can productively inform their engagement with the present.<\/p>",

This class explores the use of microprocessors, distributed sensor networks, IoT, and intermedia systems for the purposes of creative expression.&#160;The course is delivered in a mixed lecture and lab format that introduces the fundamental concepts and theory behind embedded systems as well as issues particular to their creative employment. The key objective of the course is for students to conceive of and implement creative uses of computation. To this end, skills to be obtained during the course are as follows: (1) appreciate the current efforts and motivation to push the limitations of computation for creative expression, both in new application and new foundational research; (2) weigh factors such as cost, power, processing, memory, I\/O capabilities, and networking capabilities when choosing a set of embedded devices and sensors; (3) contextualize unfamiliar hardware and languages through examples, documentation, and familiar design pattern; and (4) manage communication between multiple languages, devices, and protocols.&#160;Additionally, at the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their work in the form of writing, code, video, audio, and physical artifacts.<\/p>",

This course covers the foundations of lattice-based cryptography from fundamental definitions to advanced cryptographic constructions. More precisely, we introduce the Learning with Error (LWE) and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problems and study their unique properties, such as the fact that their average-case hardness is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. Next, we cover lattice constructions of advanced cryptographic primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signature schemes. Finally, we introduce some notions of quantum cryptography and explore the role of lattices in this area.\u202fOverall, this course offers insights into the foundations and recent advancements in lattice-based cryptography.&#160;<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>You type your question into ChatGPT and get back a response \u2013 how do you trust its accuracy? Perhaps you have reviewed the latest published benchmark results for GPT-4, or trust that others have. But how do you know the response you are getting from OpenAI\u2019s servers is the true output of GPT-4? Perhaps due to a bug or system overload your question was handled by a weaker AI model. Or worse, perhaps the servers were hacked by someone maliciously giving you incorrect results. And, how do you trust that the sensitive questions you are sending to ChatGPT will not be leaked or used against you? This is a course in cryptographic proof systems. In the digital world today, we trust services to perform many kinds of computations on our data, from managing financial ledgers and databases to complex analytics, such as large-language model (LLM) inference. We trust these services not only to operate correctly, but also to keep our information private. Cryptographic systems allow us to remove this trust. A \u201csuccinct\u201d cryptographic proof enables a service to attach a small certificate on the correctness of its computation which can be verified easily on a low-power device, even if the original computation was extremely complex. The proof of some ML computation that was run for hours on a GPU farm can fit in an email and take just milliseconds to verify on a mobile device! Beyond correctness, a \u201czero-knowledge\u201d proof system enables us to prove knowledge of secret information, including hidden inputs to a computation that achieves a certain output. For instance, OpenAI could prove that the response is the true output of GPT-4 (a proprietary model) without revealing sensitive details about the model itself. In industry, the market for cryptographic proofs is currently around $75 million and projected to reach $10 billion by 2030, according to some estimates. Cryptographic proofs have become the leading technology for scaling blockchains and achieving privacy in cryptocurrencies. Verifiable and zero-knowledge computing also create an important foundation for decentralizing AI services. Training and serving large models currently require vast resources, leading to centralization. Decentralized ML networks offer a compelling alternative\u2014letting many independent operators contribute incremental work to the overall task using their own resources big or small, from a single GPU to a server cluster, and earn a share of the payments clients make to use the service. In such a setting it is critical to verify that operators contribute incremental work correctly. Or, they may use private data to jointly train an ML model. Succinct zero-knowledge proofs would enable these operators to prove correctness of their work without revealing sensitive data. We will cover some of the other challenges and directions in decentralized model training and inference, such as reducing the amount of data that needs to be communicated between physically distributed islands of hardware and the potential role of reinforcement learning.<\/p>",

Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts. The focus is on developing solutions through a combination of foundational work such as coming up with the right definitions, modeling, algorithms, and empirical evaluation. The current focus is on bias and privacy, with additional topics including robustness, polarization, and democratic representation.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>In recent years, deep learning has seen applications in many fields, from science and technology, to finance, humanity, and businesses. However, real-world, high-impact machine learning applications demand more than just model performance. In particular, deep learning models are often required to be \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d so that domain experts can trust that the models consistently behave in a way that corresponds to their domain knowledge. For example, medical experts would expect a deep learning diagnosis model to be able to explicitly utilize medical domain knowledge in its prediction; an insurance company would expect a decision on insurance price to be explainable in terms of risk factors; a financial company would expect its fraud detection model to be robust to adversarial attacks; a physicist would expect models to provide consistency with the underlying laws. This course introduces various fields of trustworthy deep learning, including model robustness, defenses for adversarial attacks, interpretability, explainability, fairness, privacy, domain adaptation, rules, and constraints. The course covers some of these aspects in the context of graph neural networks but also covers many other ML models in general deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.<\/p>",

How do we account for strong adversaries that violate the privacy of users providing this data? This course will provide you with the knowledge to tackle research questions in these domains. We will propose answers and techniques to these broad questions from an algorithmic standpoint, presenting foundational topics such as:1) The parallel, distributed, and streaming models and algorithmic techniques commonly used within these models 2) Differential privacy and mechanisms for private data analysis 3) Implementation techniques, tools, and examples that demonstrate the practicality of these algorithms in real-world systems. This course focuses on advanced topics in practical graph algorithms with provable guarantees beyond the sequential model used in most introductory algorithms classes. Specific topics include local graph techniques for problems such as maximal matching, independent set, k-core decomposition, densest subgraphs, and coloring as well as global techniques for problems like connectivity, shortest paths, and spanners. Introductory lectures will also feature techniques used beyond graph algorithms. Students are asked to read and present influential recent research papers on these topics. Papers come from prominent CS theory conferences such as STOC, FOCS, SODA as well as database and data mining conferences like VLDB, PODS, and WWW. In addition to these presentations, students also work on a final project which may be theoretical or implementation-based. The course will also feature voluntary open problem sections where we discuss (known) practice problems and open-ended research questions related to the topics in this course in a collaborative group setting.<\/p>",

It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans\u2014\u201cSouthern Barbarians,\u201d i.e. Europeans\u2014began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as <em>baroque<\/em>, <em>rococo<\/em>, <em>mestizo<\/em>, and even <em>global modernity<\/em> are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan\u2019s great military hegemons.<\/p>",

Students analyze China\u2019s relationships with major powers and regions, including the United States, Russia, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and India, while exploring critical issues such as the Taiwan question, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and China\u2019s growing role in global governance. Special attention is paid to understanding the drivers of China\u2019s recent assertive turn in foreign policy under Xi Jinping, theories of international relations as applied to China's rise, and the implications of China\u2019s increasing power for the international order. Through engagement with scholarly works and contemporary policy debates, the course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of China\u2019s foreign relations and its emergence as a global power.<\/p>",

Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims\u2019 voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.<\/p>",

How can we bridge the gap between knowing what is right and acting accordingly? The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will explore foundational topics in Buddhist ethics, focusing on themes such as retribution, precepts, the Bodhisattva\u2019s path, meditation, and the role of feelings. The second part centers on Buddhism\u2019s responses to contemporary ethical issues, including abortion, gender, race, and environmental ethics. This course integrates both the theory and practice of ethics.

Part II focuses on case studies from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, showing how these legal systems operated in areas ranging from land disputes to violent acts of revenge. Part III then looks at some of the dramatic changes that began in the late 19th century, as foreign imperial pressure impelled their transition to Western-style laws and court systems.<\/p>",

While we focus largely on Japan and South Korea, we also have an opportunity to discuss migrant experiences in other popular destination and origin countries in Asia including China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan.&#160;Starting with the major theories and concepts in international migration, we examine East Asian migration regimes, connections between migration and high- and low-skilled labor, gender, co-ethnics, and families, as well as state, public, and civil society responses to migration.<\/p>",

This course examines the processes of political and social exclusion in South Korea, analyzing the systematic forces, such as patriarchy, nationalism, racism, and capitalism, that produce marginalization. It also explores how populations affected by such forces, including women, migrants, and LGBTQ+ communities, navigate and contest their impacts. Ultimately, this course challenges students to critically inspect how power operates in Korean society by exploring the experiences of exclusion and marginalization, as well as the possibilities and limits of resistance. While the primary focus is on contemporary issues, the course also considers their historical roots, using theoretical readings and case studies to explore both past and present dynamics.<\/p>",

Starting with pre-revolutionary writing, including the emergence of Haitian Creole letters, moving through&#160;a&#160;long, largely francophone nineteenth century, to present-day Haitian writing in the English language,&#160;this two-semester exploration of Haitian literature presents the political, cultural, and historical frameworks necessary to comprehend Haiti's vast literary output. Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences. Considering an expansive array of poets, playwrights, and novelists - such as Baron de Vastey, Juste Chanlatte, Demesvar Delorme, Edwidge Danticat, Ren\u00e9 Depestre, Kettly Mars, Dany Laferri\u00e8re, and \u00c9velyne Trouillot \u2013 this course engages students in a fresh examination of Haiti\u2019s richly polyglot and transnational literary tradition that spans more than two centuries.<\/p>",

We begin in the Archaic period with selections of Homer, then jump forward to Sophocles, Euripides, and Thucydides. Reading across these texts, we ask: how did the Greeks think about the causes of diseases? How did they diagnose illness? How did they divide responsibility for illness&#160; between gods, doctors, and patients? What role did plague and healing occupy in civic life? Alongside this thematic study, the course also offers a structured review of Greek morphology and syntax. This course is a bridge course, which is designed to transition students from L4 to L5 and which bestows L5 credit upon completion.<\/p>",

The second book, <em>Sea of Poppies<\/em> is the first novel in his epic trilogy on the Indian Ocean, which traces the journey of a diverse group people from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and China during the nineteenth century.

They could have been among the first to swear allegiance to one (or several) of 130 new states, almost twice the number that existed in 1900.&#160;They would have been certain to witness massive ecological destruction, as well as unparalleled advances in medicine, science, and the arts. The twentieth century was, as one historian puts it, an age of extremes, and in this class we explore some of these aspects of the age.&#160;The class is not intended to be a complete history nor is it one that provides an integrative interpretation of historical events. The aim is rather to enable students to know enough to think for themselves about the origins of today\u2019s world and about how historical change is created.<\/p>",

This means considering not only traditional masculine and military conceptions of rule but also the leadership roles and styles of women, slaves, and rebels. We hope to bring into view, in other words, the intersectional challenges to power faced by non-traditional leaders in a world dominated by gender, class, and cultural prejudices, and to show how non-traditional leaders confronted and overcame these. Students draw upon this experience to access the premodern world as an alternative but related historical reality which can productively inform their engagement with the present.<\/p>",

What was Judaism and who were the Jews: a religion, a history, a culture, a nation? We examine the way in which writers and artists struggled with these issues in five media: memoir, theology, history, fiction, and painting, thereby creating Jewish versions first of Enlightenment, Romanticism, and realism (1780-1870) and then of nationalism, positivism, and modernism (1870-1930). &#160;<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.<\/p>",

Focusing on the legal consciousness of South Asian migrants and the emergence of South Asian nations as political players on the global stage, this class traces how South Asian mobility led to the forging of a new global order, over migration, multiculturalism, Islamic law, civil liberties, labor law, and international law.<\/p>",

Questions about reproduction\u2013and about not reproducing\u2013are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we\u2019ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment.&#160;By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment.<\/p>",

We begin by examining the impact of colonialism on health systems, highlighting the introduction of Western medicine that dismantled local health systems and established healthcare infrastructures that primarily served colonial and elite interests. We then explore the rise of international health organizations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and the role of multilateral institutions in shaping global and local health policy in the postwar period. We also evaluate health missions between the Socialist bloc and the Third World and assess the successes and limitations of these alternative visions for promoting health equity. Over the course of the semester, we examine the experiences of health interventions and eradication programs from the perspective of recipient communities and gain an understanding of resistance, contestations, and adoption of these programs. Challenging dominant narratives that portray recipients of global health projects as passive, we evaluate how marginalized communities have variously resisted, appropriated, and shaped global technologies and ideas. Importantly, rather than following a linear North (donor) -to-South (recipient) model, we examine how the contemporary global health landscape emerged as the result of the exchange of ideas, technologies, and local knowledge and expertise between the Global North and South<\/p>",

In addition to investigating the definition of medical technology, also consider a range of themes and questions, among them: why do some technologies succeed and others fail? What is the relationship between medical technology and power? How do race, class, gender, and sexuality impact the creation and use of medical technology? We pay particular attention to the themes of expertise, authority, and identity. In addition to reading primary and secondary sources, students work closely with materials from the Medical Historical Library. Students can expect to emerge from the course prepared to analyze medical technologies and place them in historical context in American medicine.

By analyzing methodologies like classification, conservation, and scientific communication, we will discuss how divisions between the \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cunnatural\u201d were created in western cultures along unequal ideas about human bodies. Critical analyses of sources across multiple disciplines will inform conversations about knowledge production with the goal of interrogating how these power structures have silenced voices and enacted long-lasting violences on both environments and the peoples inhabiting them. Using both primary and secondary sources while conducting original research, students will learn how binary and reductive categories have been used and abused in colonial science and beyond. This class will include visits to museums around Yale\u2019s campus and beyond, with two of your assignments focused on the Peabody Museum.<\/p>",

In the first part, we examine the establishment of colonial medicine in British India, colonial interventions during plague visitations, and approaches to famine and food in the 19th century. We explore how science in colonial India was intertwined with anticolonialism, and examine anticolonial arguments against famines using modern economic sciences. In the second part, we explore pluralist practices of medicine in colonial South Asia and analyze how diverse approaches of colonial Indian medical practitioners blur the categories of \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d medicine. We then focus on colonial and postcolonial public health interventions\u2014including, regulating poisons and adulterated food, population control, and vaccination campaigns\u2014and their contestations. In the final part, we focus on the postcolonial state and explore how scientific nationalism shaped the postcolonial state\u2019s approaches to modernization and development. We examine how Indian physicists and surgeons created and maintained knowledge networks using alliances on both sides of Cold War rivalries.\"<\/p>",

But then, in the space of the next two decades, the empire seemed to disintegrate as thirteen American colonies won their independence.&#160;This course examines how all that happened, both through the eyes of professional historians and the historical figures themselves. We are guided in this course by two critical questions: How did English monarchs, ministers, and merchants build the most effective European imperial state of its time? And what was the cost?<\/p>",

From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers\u2019 rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it\u2019s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.<\/p>",

In this course, we use microhistories to examine the 17th- and 18th-century British Atlantic world as a space of immense wealth and violence, of expansion and dispossession, of cooperation and competition. Above all, it was a world of entanglements, in which peoples of the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe became drawn together in unprecedented ways. Throughout the course, students work to develop their own microhistories which explore these topics.&#160;<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Photos are windows onto known and unknows places; they are an inseparable part of how we see and understand the world. In the age of Instagram, smartphones, and #Filter-#NoFilter we are all photographers, our very own curators of visual microcosms. We produce and consume photographic images almost constantly. We are now simultaneously master, subject, and audience in a transnational consumerist visual culture. This is remarkable seeing as the technology of photography has only been around for the past 180 years. No one could have foreseen the selfie as a potential technological application. The advent of photography in 1839 as a means of visual knowledge production was entangled with the rise of modern disciplines of ordering and categorizing knowledge about both people and places. Going beyond looking at photography merely as a technology invented in and disseminated from Europe, this course attempts to analyze \u201cother histories\u201d of photography, by looking at how this global technology was appropriated locally in Asia, Africa and the Americas. It is thus a global social history of the technology of photography. This course endeavors to give students the tools to analyze photos contextually, materially, and in terms of their content by looking at the first sixty years of photography. Specifically, this course looks at the intertwined histories of early photography and the formulation of modern disciplines by focusing on how early non-European anthropologists, geographers, and archaeologists incorporated photography in their methods of picturing place and the populace. Through thematic analysis and examination of different types of archival photos, students learn how to analyze photos both in the larger context of other visual sources, such as paintings, as well as textual sources.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>",

We explore how religious and philosophical beliefs, political and economic forces, changes in technologies of lighting, human biology, and the shift from rural to urban and agrarian to industrial societies affected attitudes toward time in general and the night in particular. These changes influenced the perceptions, uses, and the ways different groups experienced nocturnal time, and how we act, sleep, work, interact, and even dream. The traditional binary view of day and night is questioned by presenting a more complex \"and dynamic face\" of the night. Nightfall provides multiple opportunities for dissent and rebellion and becomes an ideal space for marginal and subordinate people. Historical analysis, literary texts, medical and scientific writings, and primary sources provide the class with a cross-disciplinary approach to examine how the night became the abode of the ghost, the devil, the witch, and the dead, and how the night became criminalized, commercialized and even politicized. In our time, improvements in lighting changed the nocturnal world, but also had detrimental effects on sleep and dreams, and caused contemporary movements\u2013aesthetic and scientific\u2013to \"rescue\" the night.<\/p>",

From Hannah Nikole Jones\u2019 1619 Project to the first Trump administration\u2019s 1776 Commission, from the \u201coriginalism\u201d or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called \u201cdark enlightenment\u201d thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies\u2014an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields\u2014 the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and\/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what \u201cAmericanness\u201d meant, looked like, or represented.&#160;<\/p>",

How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives?&#160;This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.<\/p>",

The class explores U.S. political history broadly conceived<strong>\u2013<\/strong>not just as a realm of presidents and elections and wars (though there will be plenty of those) but as a conversation across time between citizens about what the United States is, was, and was meant to be. It proceeds from the premise that the American Revolution was the first but not the last radical act of national reimagining in U.S. history.<\/p>",

Organized chronologically, from pre-Colonial times to the present, as well as thematically, the course studies the formation and meaning of the built environment in America. The many topics encountered along the way include the public and private investment in the built environment; history of housing in America; transportation and infrastructure; architectural practice; and the social and political nature of city building and urban change. Attention also paid to the transnational nature of American architecture\u2014the role of colonialism, the global exchange of architectural ideas, and the international careers of some architects. We will take advantage of our local setting, New Haven, as a cross-section of American architectural and urban history and a storehouse of key examples of building types, urban landscapes, and architectural styles. Upon completion, students should be expected to grasp the basic periods, trends, and processes in American architectural history and their connection to urban patterns. This course aims to give students the tools to appreciate and interpret the built environments that surround them, from impressive monuments to ordinary structures<\/p>",

We consider in what way these phenomena served as historical ruptures, and in what other ways we see continuities threaded across the centuries and across diverse locales. At the same time, we learn how vibrant this world was, where political configurations changed and developed, intellectuals battled with essential questions about the nature of God, and the fundaments of the modern world were laid. We consider these subjects and many more in considering both the creative and diverse medieval world, and the ways in which scholars conceptualize its different aspects.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.<\/p>",

First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of \u201creliability\u201d concerning historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known \u201cLittle Flowers\u201d, students are also exposed to less-known \u201clives\u201d of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis\u2019 spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the \u201cgood life\u201d in contemporary America. Third, students gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio.<\/p>",

How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies. While the course is limited to the modern period, it adopts a global perspective to better understand the full scope of right-wing politics.<\/p>",

This seminar introduces students to the field of global history through a study of ideas of world order in the twentieth century. As the Eurocentric world order of the nineteenth century was shattered by global conflicts, competing worldmaking projects arose, prompting intellectuals and social scientists to race to comprehend them. The identification or declaration of a certain emerging order was often also a political intervention. Thus, to study the trajectory of the world order in the last century, we need a combined toolkit of international history and intellectual history. After surveying the political and intellectual impacts of the world wars, we will pay special attention to the twin processes of Cold War and decolonization, their origins and their aftermath. Through topics such as war and revolution, modernization and development, nationalism and capitalist globalization, students will be equipped to think critically about contemporary questions: Are we entering a new Cold War? Is empire a thing of the past? Can history inform foreign policy? We will also pay attention to world order as intellectually experienced by historical actors, especially experiences of disorder and imaginations of a new world in an eventful century. With travelers, novelists, and social scientists as well as statesmen as our guides, we will dwell on how moments of crisis and rupture such as global wars and violence, imperial dissolution, and the rapid, uneven development of capitalism gave rise to not only new institutional experiments but also new forms of subjectivity and imagination, all of which help make any idea of order plausible.<\/p>",

Students collaboratively build an archive of reproductive health histories in New Haven. This archive will be a site of academic interest, developed in response to community needs as we consider how to leverage historical research to imagine a better future. The first unit provides students with targeted methodological training in oral historical and traditional archival methods in preparation of the collection of oral histories and compilation of paper archives. The remainder of the seminar engages these methods in project work. Students use their training to build a publicly accessible reproductive health archive housed at Yale, to develop their own research questions coming out of this nascent archive, and to support New Haven organizations that can use these histories to serve their communities.<\/p>",

To understand some of the vast array of embodied practices under empire and in new national states, we consider the perspectives of multi-disciplinary scholars across a series of themes like violence, labor, war, and health. Together, we work to foster ethical engagement with historical subjects and to understand the lasting legacies of embodied histories on the social and political worlds of South Asia today.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Since the Spanish American War of 1898, US expansion overseas has shaped the political development of other nations. Nowhere is this more salient than in Latin America, a region with geographic proximity to the United States. This seminar explores the relations between the United States and Latin America, from the rise of nation states in the nineteenth century to present-day conflicts, providing an overview of the most relevant issues that shaped the history of both regions, emphasizing themes like capitalism, imperialism, and resistance. The course shows how key Latin American actors, institutions, and resources shaped the development of the United States as the dominant hegemonic power in the twentieth century. We begin in the nineteenth century, when both regions began to create alliances to combat the presence of European powers in the hemisphere. Then, we examine how US economic and military presence in Latin America was both welcomed and contested by different social sectors in both regions. We also emphasize how the Cold War dictated US strategy in the region, resulting in coups and revolutions, and how Latin America played a fundamental role in US foreign policy. This seminar exposes students to different historiographical debates about American imperialism, tracing how different scholars have characterized the unique relationship between the US and Latin America.<\/p>",

The racialized slavery that emerged in the Americas was new to World History, developed by European colonists to exploit the natural resources of the Americas. Initially, European colonists enslaved indigenous peoples wherever possible, yet by the late sixteenth century the enslavement of Africans had become far more common. We focus upon North American and the Caribbean, where European colonists developed sophisticated agricultural enterprises that produced for export to the European market and were completely dependent upon the enslaved labor of Africans. An enormous ocean commerce trafficked almost twelve million enslaved captives from the Atlantic coasts of Africa to work on the plantations of the Americas. The commerce in tobacco, sugar, rum, and cotton enabled these colonies to develop. Black people resisted enslavement at multiple levels, and throughout the Americas there emerged the Black cultures, languages, musics, struggles, and histories that we know and love today.<\/p>",

        "crn":"14959",
        "department":"RLST",
        "description":"<p>This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (<em>fiqh<\/em>), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God\u2019s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (<em>fatw\u0101<\/em>s) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing \u2013 or imperiling \u2013 the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of \u201cmodernizing\u201d the Shar\u012b\u02bfa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.&#160;<\/p>",

Part II focuses on case studies from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, showing how these legal systems operated in areas ranging from land disputes to violent acts of revenge. Part III then looks at some of the dramatic changes that began in the late 19th century, as foreign imperial pressure impelled their transition to Western-style laws and court systems.<\/p>",

It includes all conflicts and fronts from the Italian-Ottoman War of 1911 and the Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913 that initiated a new era of imperialism and nationalism with weaker empires as victims, to the mobilization of states and people across the globe from 1914 onwards, the continuation of the violence after 1918, up until the end of the Russian Civil War and the compulsory population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 that marked a new era for the relationship between states and their citizens.&#160;The seminar offers a \u201cfrom above\u201d and a \u201cfrom below\u201d view of the Greater War, examining how the war influenced, shaped, and reshaped both the states and their societies.

From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers\u2019 rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it\u2019s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.<\/p>",

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure.&#160;We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018unnatural\u2019, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Exploratory and investigative in nature, this seminar is conceived as a baseline engagement with the intersections of art, religion, science, commerce, war, and diplomacy at Kyoto and Nagasaki in the age of Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English political and mercantile interaction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans\u2014\u201cSouthern Barbarians,\u201d i.e. Europeans\u2014began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as <em>baroque<\/em>, <em>rococo<\/em>, <em>mestizo<\/em>, and even <em>global modernity<\/em> are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan\u2019s great military hegemons.<\/p>",

The author was Indigenous Andean Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (c. 1535\u2013c. 1616). This work is one of the most important sources for understanding Inka culture and colonial rule from an Indigenous perspective. It consists of 1,189 pages with 398 full-page ink line drawings. Few illustrated manuscripts survive from this period, and Guaman Poma\u2019s has no rival. The&#160;<em>New Chronicle<\/em>&#160;was written in Peru in Spanish, Quechua, Aymara, and Latin. But one might even consider the many images a fifth, purely visual language that combined Andean and European representation systems. Its images have become the most common illustrations of Andean history.

        "description":"<p>The course explores the more controversial, hidden, and overlooked aspects of the Italian Renaissance. While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de\u2019 Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals\u2013such as Isabella D\u2019Este\u2019s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci\u2013was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u2019s brother, Caterina de\u2019 Medici\u2019s agency, and Borgia\u2019s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era. This course counts as language across the curriculum (LxC).<\/p>",

Organized chronologically, from pre-Colonial times to the present, as well as thematically, the course studies the formation and meaning of the built environment in America. The many topics encountered along the way include the public and private investment in the built environment; history of housing in America; transportation and infrastructure; architectural practice; and the social and political nature of city building and urban change. Attention also paid to the transnational nature of American architecture\u2014the role of colonialism, the global exchange of architectural ideas, and the international careers of some architects. We will take advantage of our local setting, New Haven, as a cross-section of American architectural and urban history and a storehouse of key examples of building types, urban landscapes, and architectural styles. Upon completion, students should be expected to grasp the basic periods, trends, and processes in American architectural history and their connection to urban patterns. This course aims to give students the tools to appreciate and interpret the built environments that surround them, from impressive monuments to ordinary structures<\/p>",

It offers first year students an opportunity to study the world's finest collection of British paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints and rare books. Developing skills in visual analysis and engaging with historical contexts, the class will examine works of art in the relation to the fraught history of Britain and its empire. The industrial revolution, the role of women, the growth of cities and the rise of democratic politics will emerge as major themes. Looking at Britain's role in the world, we will undertake a critical appraisal of works of art produced in the North America, Caribbean, India, Australia and South Africa.<\/p>",

Traveling across the spectrum of its divergent meanings\u2014novelty, ingenuity, unconventionality, distinctiveness, authenticity, fundamentality, fidelity\u2014we will track how originality came to be a desideratum of modern subjects, and how \u201coriginals\u201d came to be their proper object of study and love. We will also consider how appeals to the elsewhere and erstwhile have buttressed the concept, reinforcing the presumed priority of a European center against a peripheral rest-of-the-world supposedly under its influence. Is originality a value to defend, or is it a resource claimed by some and denied to others? How have our increasingly sophisticated technical capacities for reproduction, replication, and most recently, generation, tested our intuitions about originality? Facing a seeming infinity of sources, as well as their forceful algorithmic channeling, what is original work today? Themes include: authorship and authenticity, sources and influence, anachronism and pseudomorphism, seriality, reproduction, appropriation and citation, style and similitude.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>In colonial-era scholarship about South Asia, modernity is often written about as an aspirational project. Becoming modern is understood as becoming European, thus making it impossible for the region to be both itself and modern at the same time. Scholarship across disciplines has long critiqued this Eurocentric understanding of modernity, not only for its colonial underpinnings, but also for its failure to reckon with the global processes that constitute modernity\u2019s transformations. This critique significantly contributed to the study of modernist art and visual culture in South Asia. Taking inspiration from Geeta Kapur\u2019s canonical essay \u201cWhen Was Modernism in Indian Art?\u201d, this course uses art and visual culture to examine the historical, social, and political transformations that took place in the region from the late 19th to the mid-20th century. Periods and genres covered by the course include colonial era photography, nationalist \u201coriental\u201d painting from the early 20th century, the emergence of modernist art movements in the mid-twentieth century, cinema, and architecture. The course will be of interest to students who wish to better understand theories of modernity from a more global framework and those who have prior knowledge of Euro-American modernism and art history.<\/p>",

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure.&#160;We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018unnatural\u2019, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.<\/p>",

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de\u2019 Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals\u2013such as Isabella D\u2019Este\u2019s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci\u2013was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u2019s brother, Caterina de\u2019 Medici\u2019s agency, and Borgia\u2019s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era. This course counts as language across the curriculum (LxC).<\/p>",

In a world governed by norms and standards (against the appearance of laxness and relativism), \"badness\" and amateurism are inevitable. \"Bad\" works can be extremely popular and influential (e.g., in the cases of pseudoscience, misinformation, racism, antisemitism). The \"bad\" archive contributes to a reevaluation of critical standards, forms of official and unofficial censorship, freedom of speech and the function of taboos. The course explores famous works that have been considered aesthetically, morally, ideologically and politically pernicious (stopping short, however, of screeds and manifestos like Hitler's <em>Mein Kampf<\/em>).

Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Uwe Johnson's <em>Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl<\/em> remains a monument of postwar German literature \u2013 and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>",

The history of murder, violence, and criminal investigation is as old as humankind. Yet, crime is not always considered evil, nor is evil always associated with crime. In this course, we discuss how the way evil was perceived and crime was punished has changed throughout history. From mythical accounts of murders, to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide or witchcraft, we analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across Eastern and Western civilizations. We compare codified-law civilizations to those in which custom, social pressure, and community ethics determined correct behavior. Four historical cold cases with accompanying evidence are presented for in-class debate, and\u2026 perhaps students may be able to help solve an old mystery! At the end of the semester, we recreate historical trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the historical settings covered in this course.

We study the different ways of awarding book prizes and curating lists of literature. Additionally, we study the circumstances that lead to literary \u201chypes,\u201d including Netflix adaptations, BookTok, and the author-as-celebrity. We&#160;read novels and excerpts of novels by some of the&#160;<em>New York Times\u2019<\/em>&#160;top-ranked authors, as well as by Nobel Prize laureates of recent years, and compare the different modes of selection and the benefits as well as biases inherent to the respective lists.&#160;We also look at currently circulating lists of \u201cbanned books\u201d and the works of literature banned from official reading lists and syllabi to understand another aspect of the politics behind the curation of lists.&#160;We close our literary journey with a text by author Toni Morrison who, curiously, made all three lists.<\/p>",

Readings are drawn from sources both ancient and modern, from discourses including religion, philosophy, alchemy, literature, and psychoanalysis.

Through a literary journey from the late 18th&#160;century to the mid 20th&#160;century, students consider how the Russian literary tradition and national identity were shaped by fraught exchanges between Russians and Western Europeans, as well as by Russia\u2019s expansion eastward. We read canonical works by writers who questioned or supported empires and think through ways in which they influenced one another. Through close readings, historicization, and theorization, students gain new perspectives on the issues of belonging and alienation in changing imperial contexts.&#160;<\/p>",

The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli\u2019s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty.

In this seminar, we read plays about death, war, revenge, madness, impossible choices, calamitous errors, and the destruction of whole peoples. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were also piercing observers of political life. No less than Plato and Aristotle, the Attic tragedians write to elicit reflection on the basic patterns of politics: democracy and tyranny, war and peace, the family and the city, the rule of law and violence. Finally, we also approach Greek tragedy through its reception. Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Nietzsche: all these thinkers responded to tragedy. Texts include Aeschylus,&#160;<em>Oresteia;&#160;<\/em>Aristophanes,&#160;<em>Frogs&#160;<\/em>and&#160;<em>Lysistrata<\/em>; Euripides,&#160;<em>Bacchae<\/em>,&#160;<em>Heracles<\/em>, and&#160;<em>Trojan Women<\/em>; Nietzsche,&#160;<em>The Birth of Tragedy<\/em>; Plato,&#160;<em>Symposium<\/em>; and Sophocles,&#160;<em>Antigone<\/em>,&#160;<em>Philoctetes<\/em>, and&#160;<em>Oedipus Tyrannus.<\/em><\/p>",

This course aims both to break and to refresh them. Examples will range chronologically from ancient to modern times, and will be taken from a broad range of traditions and institutions. Particular attention will be paid to the origins and growth of the research university, and the costs and benefits involved in the modern institutionalization of learning. We will focus on\u2014in the words of a noted, but now neglected Yale psychologist (Seymour Sarason)\u2014how education has, especially in modern western societies like ours, become both \u201cscapegoat and salvation.\u201d<\/p>",

What might an AI-induced shift in how we manipulate information, generate sound, create visual art (both still and moving images), and tell stories signify in the realm of culture, and what might it portend for our sense of who we are in the world? How should we situate AI, when viewed through the lens of culture at large, within the story of modernity? While the recent uproar concerning large language models (LLMs) in AI is only two years old, AI as a field has, however, existed for almost seventy years now. This course looks at AI and explore its relation with culture in a threefold way: through (i) <em>historicizing<\/em> (by looking at the historical cultural conditions that enabled or facilitated certain habits of thought or r\u00e9gimes of truth that led to present-day AI); (ii) <em>analogizing<\/em> (by tracing the similarities between patterns of expression in culture and developments in AI); and (iii) <em>contextualizing<\/em>&#160;(tracing how cultural artifacts have influenced AI\u2019s directions and vice versa).

We address these questions in a global sense as much as we can: while the culture of Western modernity will figure very prominently in the readings and discussion, we take a more enlarged perspective, with some of the readings being about, and\/or from, places and imaginaries beyond the West: China, Afrofuturism, and South Asia. Readings consist mostly of imaginative literary works (short stories, and excerpts from longer novels), but also encompasses some non-fiction and graphic fiction. At least two weeks of class also focuses on non-textual culture (theater, film, paintings, and music that is connected to AI).

We spend the first part of the course considering the theoretical origins of the doppelg\u00e4nger in gothic literature, turning to concepts of \u201cthe self and other\u201d from psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial theory to help us think broadly through the category. In the second part of the course, we read works of literature that feature encounters with a large cast of doppelg\u00e4nger sub-types, including alter-egos, shadows, ghosts, and evil twins. Finally, we revisit the doppelg\u00e4nger trope in the digital age to interrogate how advanced technologies have altered the possibilities for \u201cdoubling\u201d through innovations such as AI, cloning, and biogenetic de-extinction projects.<\/p>",

My goal is for you to develop a framework to discuss literary works that are based on recognizable current, autobiographical, or historical events, while also developing skills as a writer.&#160; Where possible, we invite the authors of some of our selections to speak to the class about their work. The class features a combination of \u201cmessy\u201d informal writing-to-learn practices and exercises, as well as two polished formal assignments. The midterm assignment takes the form of a review essay in which you use the work of one or two chosen authors to explore the genre, demonstrating an understanding of both the power and the potential pitfalls of using literary techniques to get at \u201chistory in the raw\u201d. The second formal assignment builds on this approach; part of the process includes your own short work of creative nonfiction that helps you think through some of the theoretical challenges of the form.&#160;&#160;<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Although we spend approximately one third of our lives asleep, since the industrial revolution and the emergence of uninterrupted city lighting, industrialized societies seem to have developed an ambivalent relation to sleep: both protected and devalued for the sake of higher standards of productive work. The devaluation of sleep, in particular, has produced, during the twentieth and the first two decades of the twenty-first centuries, an array of social, political, and medical discourses to study the impact of changing patterns of sleep and sleeplessness at the global level. This seminar studies topics in the politics and cultures of sleep and sleeplessness, which posit sleep as a human practice. As any human practice, it is framed by cultural and political settings, so that how, when, why, where, and who sleeps vary across sectors of society, across past and present and across world cultures. We study historical, literary, philosophical, sociological, political, and filmic texts. A cultural, social, and political understanding of sleep and sleeplessness can reveal how sleep has been transformed into a bodily site upon which social values are imposed, social surveillance is enacted, ideas about \u201cnormality\u201d are instrumentalized, resulting in a demand that humans adapt to human-made changing conditions of production, rather than universally unchanging health needs.<\/p>",

Consideration is also be given to the poets (and artists) who most influenced Stevens, to poetic contemporaries such as Eliot and Frost, and to his own connection to major trends in both Romanticism and Modernism. We also trace the spiritual contours of Stevens\u2019s work against the background of a larger 20th-century critique of religion and even loss of religion, and ask whether Stevens was primarily a secular or, despite himself, religious poet\u2026 or if such a distinction itself proves false. &#160;&#160;<\/p>",

Students present and discuss original papers in class. They learn to model using MatLab in a series of in-class hackathons that illustrate the biological examples discussed in the lectures. Biological systems and processes that are modeled include: (i) gene expression, including the kinetics of RNA and protein synthesis and degradation; (ii) activators and repressors; (iii) the lysogeny\/lysis switch of lambda phage; (iv) network motifs and how they shape response dynamics; (v) cell signaling, MAP kinase networks and cell fate decisions; and (vi) noise in gene expression.<\/p>",

The course begins with Jeremiah's prophecies, then explores the Mishnaic \"Ethics of Our Fathers\" and Hebrew poetry written by Medieval Jewish Spanish poets like Judah ha-Levi and Shmuel HaNagid. Among the authors we will discuss are Franz Kafka, Paul Celan, Edmond Jab\u00e8s, Primo Levi, Philip Roth, and Israeli writers such as S. Y. Agnon, Shimon Ballas, Dalia Ravikovitz, and A.B. Yehoshua.&#160;The poetics of Jewish literatures will be studied alongside religion, ethnicity, class differences, diaspora, and family relationships, as well as gender issues, minorities, and nationalism.&#160;&#160;<\/p>",

Albert Einstein was at the center of these breakthroughs, and also became an iconic figure beyond physics, representing scientist genius engaged in pure research into the fundamental laws of nature.

By the end of the course, participants will familiarize themselves with the crucial roles that religious beliefs and practices play in causing and responding to human mobilities. Students will also gain familiarity with the ways in which migrants' religious practices transform local cultures, politics, and societies as their own religious practices are reconfigured by and in the context of host nations.

Are these ideas more consistent with later Jewish and Christian notions of death and the afterlife, or are they closer to the views of their ancient Near Eastern neighbors? In this course we examine the development of biblical and ancient Near Eastern concepts of death and life-after-death. We look at a variety of different types of texts that touch upon these themes, such as narrative, poetry, ritual, and law in biblical and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Topics include the depiction of human mortality and divine immortality in literature, dying as a social process, the development of the notion of an afterlife and the concept of the \u2018soul\u2019, and communication with the dead, how these texts have been received in the West, and how they have shaped inherited ideas of the immortality of the soul, human suffering, and divine justice. The aim of the course is to develop an awareness of the ancient historical and cultural context in which these texts were authored, and to deepen our understanding of modern views of mortality.<\/p>",

Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.<\/p>",

Together, we will examine how Buddhism addresses fundamental moral and ethical questions, such as: How should I behave? What are the implications of my actions? What is good and bad? How can we bridge the gap between knowing what is right and acting accordingly? The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will explore foundational topics in Buddhist ethics, focusing on themes such as retribution, precepts, the Bodhisattva\u2019s path, meditation, and the role of feelings. The second part centers on Buddhism\u2019s responses to contemporary ethical issues, including abortion, gender, race, and environmental ethics. This course integrates both the theory and practice of ethics. The structure and assignments are designed to help you engage with theoretical systems that may differ from those you are familiar with, while also applying these abstract ideas to reflect on the relationship between theory and practice.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism\u2019s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition.&#160;This course seeks to take both challenges head-on. Its pedagogical intent is threefold. First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of \u201creliability\u201d concerning historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known \u201cLittle Flowers\u201d, students are also exposed to less-known \u201clives\u201d of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis\u2019 spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the \u201cgood life\u201d in contemporary America. Third, students gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio.<\/p>",

How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies.

In Senegal, over 95% of the population adheres to Islam, while more than 79% of Egyptians identify as Muslim. Nigeria has the largest Muslim population on the continent, with over 100 million Muslims. This course focuses on the histories, politics, and cultures of Muslim Africa. We examine the spread of Islam across the continent from the 7th century through trade, education, and jihad. Drawing primarily from anthropology, we explore the impact of faith on governance and social structures, as well as its interactions with other religious traditions on the continent. By the end of the course, students will: a) learn about key issues in the study of Islam in Africa, including Islam noir, Africanization of Islam, Ajami, and lived Islam, b) develop tools for studying how Africans on the continent and the diaspora practice Islam in various contexts and time periods, and c) acquire research skills for studying Islam ethnographically.<\/p>",

        "crn":"14958",
        "department":"RLST",
        "description":"<p>This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (<em>fiqh<\/em>), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God\u2019s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (<em>fatw\u0101<\/em>s) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing \u2013 or imperiling \u2013 the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of \u201cmodernizing\u201d the Shar\u012b\u02bfa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.&#160;<\/p>",

What can they tell us about the past?&#160;How do we&#160;analyze the roles of the narrator, the author, and the protagonist? How should&#160;we understand the ideological tensions between official histography and&#160;personal&#160;reminiscences, especially in 20th-century Russia? This&#160;course aims to answer these questions through close readings of a few cultural&#160;celebrities\u2019 memoirs and autobiographical&#160;writings that are also widely&#160;acknowledged as the best representatives of 20th-century Russian&#160;prose. Along the way, we read literary texts in dialogue with theories of&#160;memory, historiography, and narratology. Students acquire the theoretical&#160;apparatus that enables them to analyze the complex ideas, e.g. cultural memory&#160;and trauma,&#160;historicity and narrativity, and fiction and non-fiction. Students finish the course with an in-depth knowledge of the major themes of 20th-century&#160;Russian history, e.g.&#160;empire, revolution, war, Stalinism, and exilic experience,&#160;as well as increased skills in the analysis of literary texts. Students with knowledge of Russian are encouraged to read in the original language. All readings are&#160;available in English.&#160;<\/p>",

This course considers travel and emigration in imperial contexts and brings Russian literature into conversation with European literature. We explore narratives of imperial exceptionalism, Russian parochialism, and the broader imperial contexts that shaped the world in the 19th&#160;and 20th centuries. Through a literary journey from the late 18th&#160;century to the mid 20th&#160;century, students consider how the Russian literary tradition and national identity were shaped by fraught exchanges between Russians and Western Europeans, as well as by Russia\u2019s expansion eastward. We read canonical works by writers who questioned or supported empires and think through ways in which they influenced one another. Through close readings, historicization, and theorization, students gain new perspectives on the issues of belonging and alienation in changing imperial contexts.&#160;<\/p>",

Focusing mostly on Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran immigrants\u2014the three largest groups in the United States\u2014we explore the social structures that constrain individuals as well as the strategies and behaviors immigrants and their communities have taken to establish their presence and make a home in U.S. society and stay connected to their countries of origin.

We reflect on the debates and theories in the study of informality in the U.S. and beyond and gain an understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, rationale, advantages and disadvantages, and socio-spatial implications of informal cities.

Academic researchers produce enormous amounts of data and knowledge about social problems like poverty, and yet the poverty rate has remained almost unchanged for fifty years. Likewise, there are reams of historical and social scientific studies about major social problems such as racism, gun violence, abortion access, and climate change. In this seminar, we examine the social processes through which all of this knowledge is ignored by policymakers and others with power to make change. How does increasing knowledge keep resulting in inaction?<\/p>",

The US carceral state is sweeping, with nearly 2 million people currently incarcerated on any given day and a targeted policing apparatus that brings people under the penal net. At the same time, countries in Latin America have high rates of incarceration and often even higher rates of police violence than the US. These dynamics are deeply racialized and shape individuals, families, and communities. But that is not the full story. Liberatory movements have resisted and surged against this subjugation for decades. In this course, students will comparatively study the development of the contemporary carceral state and the political struggles waged against it. Students will read across the social sciences, Black studies, history, and law, as well as performance, memoir, and testimony. By examining the carceral state in this way, students will gain a critical lens on longstanding debates related to race and racism, justice and injustice, and reparation and abolition, in both the US and Latin America. While the course is not exhaustive, it is meant to equip students with a working framework on the critical debates in the field.<\/p>",

There is also considerable hype surrounding AI and many concerns (some justified, some not) regarding the use of this type of technology. This discussion-based seminar will 1) provide undergraduate students across disciplines with a broad overview of issues related to AI in medicine at a non-technical level, drawing on perspectives from the interpretive\/humanistic social sciences, computing, engineering, and healthcare and 2) model interdisciplinary communication and build a robust framework for collaboration. Overarching topics, grounded in medical case studies, include what it means for computers to \u201cthink\u201d and how we understand what they are thinking about; the use and limits of scientific knowledge in making policy decisions; bias, fairness, equity, equality; the challenges of implementation of AI systems; safety and risk; and the human\/computer interface. The course also provides a high level overview of machine learning, discussing opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs. Ultimately, the course offers a grounded look at how AI is being discussed and deployed on the ground in medicine, equipping students with a critical lens for thinking about responsible and practical implementation and innovation when it comes to AI.<\/p>",

The study of western news representation of Africa (and the global south) and the dynamics of differential reporting is not new. However, what do we actually know about how African media represent genocide and mass atrocities that occur in Africa? How does the news create and reinforce knowledge about mass atrocities? How can the media both generate and rely on knowledge? Is there a difference between the knowledge produced by African media and media from the global north? These are the questions that will guide us for the semester.&#160;<\/p>",

Readings and discussions focus primarily on the British New Wave (from about 1979 to 1985) and K-Pop (1992-present), but we also discuss first-wave reggae, ska, rocksteady from the 1960s-70s, British and American punk rock music (1970s-1980s), the precursors of modern K-Pop, and have a brief discussion of Japanese City Pop. The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.<\/p>",

It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p class=\"p1\">The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives.&#160;Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples\u2019 responses to bordering process and globalization?&#160;<\/p>",

Throughout the semester, we explore a wide array of artistic expressions (essays, short stories, sound, poetry, photography, painting, etc.), which allows us to both appreciate and interrogate the many ways in which interactions with nature are depicted and performed in different Hispanophone cultures. Our analysis of these texts is complemented by carrying out and reflecting upon our own practice of ecological mindfulness. This course is taught in Spanish.<\/p>",

Taught in Spanish, it examines themes such as gastronomy, music, and visual arts within broader historical, social, and political contexts. Students engage critically with culinary arts, various musical genres, and visual works through readings, museum visits, guest speakers, and creative assignments. Key objectives include visual literacy and curatorial studies, supported by visits to the Yale Art Gallery to work with objects and mini-exhibitions. The course also features intercultural remote exchanges with students from Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, fostering intercultural competence. By the end of the course, students are equipped with the analytical skills to critically assess the role of art in creating collective memory and to articulate their insights within an academic framework.<\/p>",

Students analyze how films reconstruct memory, challenge hegemonic historiography, and reinscribe erased or silenced perspectives. The course reflects on the relevance of these works in contemporary struggles against violence and oppression, considering how they teach us to critically engage with power, resistance, and collective memory. It also focuses on women's cinematic productions and representations, examining how gender, race, and political resistance intersect in the visual representation of repression, violence, and memory.

Through this guided study of tarot, we explore tarot\u2019s enduring, yet contested appeal and relativize Western epistemologies, including that of the academy itself.<\/p>",

As a language course, it allows students to engage with multiple modes of meaning\u2013linguistic, visual, auditory, tactile, gestural, and spatial\u2013through which cinema conveys its narratives. Students analyze how films reconstruct memory, challenge hegemonic historiography, and reinscribe erased or silenced perspectives. The course reflects on the relevance of these works in contemporary struggles against violence and oppression, considering how they teach us to critically engage with power, resistance, and collective memory. It also focuses on women's cinematic productions and representations, examining how gender, race, and political resistance intersect in the visual representation of repression, violence, and memory. The course incorporates both Spanish and Portuguese, encouraging students to express their ideas and develop projects in either language. Languages: Portuguese and Spanish.<\/p>",

Beginning with a brief consideration of psychoanalytic conceptions of \u2018the subject\u2019, \u2018subjectivity\u2019 and their relation to social formations, this course examines some of the ways in which subjectivity has been theorized and brought under critical scrutiny by black diasporic, feminist and queer scholars.

It aims to critique the divide between \u2018interior\u2019 psychic life and \u2018exterior\u2019 social selves, as well as considering the relation between \u2018freedom\u2019 and subjectivity, including the extent to which \u2018freedom\u2019 might require rejection of \u2018subjectivity\u2019 as a mode of personhood.<\/p>",

        "description":"<p>While monogamy is central to Michel Foucault\u2019s formulation of normative sexuality that arose in the 19th century (the Malthusian couple as adult, monogamous, heterosexual, married, and reproductive), little attention has been paid to it as a particular historical form of intimacy. We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and\/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the \u201cWest\u201d as a radical and \u201cliberated\u201d alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists\u2019 youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.<\/p>",

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love.&#160;In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other?&#160;In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States. In this section, we explore reining assumptions between romantic love and: marriage; monogamy; dating; the digital environment; queerness; age; and transnationalism.<\/p>",

The US carceral state is sweeping, with nearly 2 million people currently incarcerated on any given day and a targeted policing apparatus that brings people under the penal net. At the same time, countries in Latin America have high rates of incarceration and often even higher rates of police violence than the US. These dynamics are deeply racialized and shape individuals, families, and communities. But that is not the full story. Liberatory movements have resisted and surged against this subjugation for decades. In this course, students will comparatively study the development of the contemporary carceral state and the political struggles waged against it. Students will read across the social sciences, Black studies, history, and law, as well as performance, memoir, and testimony. By examining the carceral state in this way, students will gain a critical lens on longstanding debates related to race and racism, justice and injustice, and reparation and abolition, in both the US and Latin America. While the course is not exhaustive, it is meant to equip students with a working framework on the critical debates in the field.<\/p>",

This brilliant coinage offers an immanent theorization of texture as something like an x-factor\u2014an excess and an essence, something magical yet practical, a strange intensity and the thing itself. Such ambiguities, however, also contribute to texture\u2019s interpretive difficulties. For whether we have in mind a velvet armchair, a pair of distressed jeans, a handbound book, or a tablet computer, texture performs a dramatic revelation to the extent that it is also shadowed by deception and ambivalence.&#160;These paradoxes and cruxes inspire a range of inquiries for our class: What can the perception and creation of texture teach us about the sensorial and material politics of race, gender, empire, capitalism, and art? How might texture help us study the relation between desire and violence, especially at the interface of touch? What things, beings, events, places, emotions, and ideas appear to have a texture? What is texture\u2019s route to intelligibility, and is there a scale or unit at which texture vanishes?<\/p>",

It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.<\/p>",

The course reflects on the relevance of these works in contemporary struggles against violence and oppression, considering how they teach us to critically engage with power, resistance, and collective memory. It also focuses on women's cinematic productions and representations, examining how gender, race, and political resistance intersect in the visual representation of repression, violence, and memory. The course incorporates both Spanish and Portuguese, encouraging students to express their ideas and develop projects in either language. Languages: Portuguese and Spanish.<\/p>",

Unpacking the body\u2019s role as a site of power in imperial, nationalist, and postcolonial politics, we investigate how our narratives of history deepen when we make questions of race, caste, gender, sexuality, and disability central to our narratives. To understand some of the vast array of embodied practices under empire and in new national states, we consider the perspectives of multi-disciplinary scholars across a series of themes like violence, labor, war, and health. Together, we work to foster ethical engagement with historical subjects and to understand the lasting legacies of embodied histories on the social and political worlds of South Asia today.<\/p>",
